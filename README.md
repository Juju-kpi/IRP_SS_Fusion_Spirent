# IRP_SS_Fusion_Spirent
## IRP about Sensor fusion using Transformer NN
A first use case of using Transformer architecture to design a sensor fusion (IMU/GNSS) algorithm for pose estimation. The dataset has been generated in Hardware in the loop simulation with Spirent's simulator to get the GNSS data, that are then process to a consummer-grade Ublox gnss receiver with SIMSensors to generate the corresponding IMU data.  
Please see the PDF file to have an insight of the main methodology of the project.
